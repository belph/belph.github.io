My name is Philip Blair and I am a Computer Science and Mathematics student at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts.

I enjoy spending my spare time learning about new things, whether it be Number-Theoretic concepts or the inner workings of the Linux kernel.
I am a member of the [Northeastern Crew Club](https://github.com/crew/), with whom I frequently find myself working on neat club projects 
(including a [distributed display system](https://github.com/crew/dds-client) and a [deployment of OpenStack](http://cloud.northeastern.me)) 
and many fun side projects.

That is more or less the gist of what I do these days.
